## To-Do

Additions I need to make to complete this resource (suggestions welcome!).

1. Fill out books section.
    - Get links for all materials.
    - Compare content to determine level of difficulty.
    - Order content based on findings.
2. Create a section for libraries and tools for people to learn and use based on their needs.
    - Create sections for the name with a link to the main page or repository, a section about its use case, and a section for the tool's current version at the time of writing.
